## Neovim configuration

This repository is my personal configuration of neovim using Lua.

## Installation

Once neovim is installed, clone the repository to a directory of your choice.

- Go into the `.config` directory and create a symbolic link from the `nvim` directory to the path `/home/user/.config`
```shell
    ln -s path/nvim .
```
- Open neovim and run the command `:PackerInstall`

## Addtional
To use functions such as search for a string or Find and Replace you need to install `ripgrep` and `gnu-sed`
```Shell
#Mac Os
brew install ripgrep

#Linux
sudo apt-get install ripgrep

```

```Shell
#Mac Os
brew install gnu-sed

```
